# Visual Interfaces Final Project

This application should be run with `python positionTracker.py' in order to properly execute the code, along with installing the required libraries listed within the code.
For this application, a user enters a filepath to a video within positionTracker.py, and frames are first taken from the video, have their background removed, and then are processed to find facial features and determine if those within the video are focused or unfocused.
